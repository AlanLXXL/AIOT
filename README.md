Aritificial Intelligence of Things 
## Lecture 1
- Try raspberry pi to do weather forecast
- The key in handling data is to do more tasks on the sensor part
- Machine learning part is based on the collected data (for example: Decision tree)
## Lecture 2
- Try single-board microcontroller
- Enable concurrent running (A, B, A+B commands)
- Event Driven (Block Programming)
- 6 milliseconds limitation
- non-preemptive scheduling ï¼ˆwait until it finished the CPU cycle)
- micro-bit tutorial

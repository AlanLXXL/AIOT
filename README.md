Aritificial Intelligence of Things 
## Lecture 1
- Try raspberry pi to do weather forecast
- The key in handling data is to do more tasks on the sensor part
- Machine learning part is based on the collected data (for example: Decision tree)
## Lecture 2
- Try single-board microcontroller
- Enable concurrent running (A, B, A+B commands)
- Event Driven (Block Programming)
- 6 milliseconds limitation
- non-preemptive scheduling ï¼ˆwait until it finished the CPU cycle)
- micro-bit sensor different sensor input
- micro-bit tutorial
  1. block
  2. python
## Lecture 3
- Single-board microcontroller part
  1. Different Components in electronic components
  2.  analogue-to-digital converter (ADC)
  3.  Serial Communication
  4.  Used as an Edge Connector
## Lecture 4
- Single-board computer part
  1. Raspberry pi to handle more compact data information compared to micro-bit
